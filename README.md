## Mysign.id - A new era of digital signatures, secured, verified, and uniquely yours

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

Mysign.id is an AI and ZKP based platform transforming the way we use digital signatures. By combining the convenience of traditional wet signatures with the security and immutability of web3 technology, Mysign.id ensures that your signature is digitized, minted, and stored securely on the blockchain and is as unique and legally binding as its inked counterpart.

### Key Features

- **Signature Minting** - Each signature is securely minted as a unique NFT, ensuring that your signature is only accessible to you.
- **Metadata** - Everytime you mint a signature, mysign.id will extract and store your unique signature metadata, like the shape and edges of your signature on the blockchain to provide you with a secure signature profile.
- **Built on Aleph Zero** - Utilizing Aleph Zero and Liminal's privacy layer, Mysign.id ensures fast, private, and secure transactions.
- **Signature Verification** - Mysign leverages zero-knowledge proofs for signature verification. Upload an image of a signature and verify its authenticity associated with a user's address or Aleph Zero ID. (Coming Soon, built on Aleph Zero Liminal)
- **Integration with existing platforms** - Mysign.id can be integrated with existing platforms like Docusign, allowing you to sign documents with your real signature from any device using your wallet. (Coming Soon, mysign.id SDK)

### How It Works

Mysign.id extracts distinctive properties from your signature during the minting process. These properties are securely stored as metadata along with the NFT. Using OpenCV, scikit-learn, and DIS techniques, Mysign.id can compare any uploaded signature image with the minted signature for verification, providing a proof of match or non-match.

At the heart of Mysign ZKP is Liminal, Aleph Zero's multichain privacy framework.Whether it's a bank verifying a signature, a notary authenticating a document, or a fan collecting a digital autograph, Mysign ensures that the process is private, secure, and verifiable.

### Possible Use Cases

- **Banking** - Mysign.id can be integrated with banks/banking entities to verify signatures on checks and other physical banking documents to prevent fraud. With Mysign.id zero-knowledge verifications the bank can verify the authenticity of a signature without having to store the signature on their servers or share it with third parties.
- **Notary** - Mysign.id can be used by notaries to verify signatures on documents. This can be used to verify the authenticity of documents and prevent fraud.
- **Digital Autographs** - Mysign.id can be used by celebrities and influencers to mint their signatures as NFTs and sell them to fans. Users can use the Mysign.id ZKP to verify the authenticity of the signature. (Coming Soon)
- **Document Signing & Storage** - The next goal on the Mysign.id roadmap is to build a decentralized document signing and storage platform. Users can sign documents their personal documents with the Mysign.id signature and even do multi-party signing. The signed documents can be stored on IPFS and the signature can be verified using the Mysign.id ZKP. (Coming Soon)

Mysign.id is more than a tool; it's a vision to empower users with a digital signature solution that's as natural as pen on paper yet backed by the strongest blockchain security. It's about giving users control and confidence in their digital interactions and by integrating with Aleph Zero and Liminal, Mysign is setting a new standard for privacy, security, and convenience in digital signatures.

## Getting started üöÄ

### 1. Run the frontend

The frontend works out of the box, without a local node running, as the sample contract is pre-deployed on certain live testnets (i.e. `alephzero-testnet` and `shibuya`). Necessary deployment metadata and addresses are provided under `contracts/deployments/`.

> **Pre-requisites:**
>
> - Setup Node.js v18+ (recommended via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with `nvm install 18`)
> - Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended via [Node.js Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) or `npm i -g pnpm`)
> - Clone this repository

<details>
<summary><strong>Special Instructions for Windows Users</strong></summary>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Windows users must either use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) (recommended) or a custom shell like [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). PowerShell is not supported.

> **Pre-requisites when using WSL for Linux:**
>
> - Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) and execute _all_ commands in the WSL terminal
> - Setup Node.js v18+ (recommended via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with `nvm install 18`)
> - Install the following npm packages globally:
> - `npm i -g npm`
> - `npm i -g pnpm node-gyp make`
> - Clone this repository into the WSL file system (e.g. `/home/<user>/inkathon`).
>
> **Tip:** You can enter `\\wsl$\` in the top bar of the Windows Explorer to access the WSL file system visually.

</details>

```bash
# Install dependencies (once)
# NOTE: This automatically creates an `.env.local` file
pnpm install

# Start Next.js frontend
pnpm run dev
```

Optionally, to enable [`simple-git-hooks`](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks) (for automatic linting & formatting when committing), you can run the following command once: `pnpm simple-git-hooks`.

### 2. Build & deploy contracts on a local node

The `contracts/package.json` file contains shorthand scripts for building, testing, and deploying your contracts. To run these scripts, you need to set `contracts/` as the active working directory in your terminal.

> **Pre-requisites:**
>
> - Install Rust via the [Substrate Docs](https://docs.substrate.io/install/) (skip the "Compile a Substrate node" section)
> - Install [`cargo contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract)
> - Install [`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node)

```bash
# Build contracts and move artifacts to `contracts/deployments/{contract}/` folders
pnpm run build

# Start local node with persistence (contracts stay deployed after restart)
# NOTE: When using Brave, shields have to be taken down for the UIs
pnpm run node

## IMPORTANT: Open a separate terminal window and keep the node running

# Deploy the contracts on the local node
pnpm run deploy
```

Alternatively, you can also deploy contracts manually using [Contracts UI](https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/) (`pnpm contracts-ui`) in the browser.

### 3. Connect the frontend to the local node

Open the `frontend/.env.local` file and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_CHAIN` variable to `development`. Then restart the frontend and you should be able to interact with the contracts deployed on your local node.

_Read more about environment variables and all available chain constants in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below._

## Customization üé®

### 1. Project Name

There are multiple places where you need to insert your project's name and identifier. Most of these occurrences are highlighted with a `/* TODO */` comment in the code. You can easily replace them one by one by installing the [`todo-tree`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gruntfuggly.todo-tree) plugin.

Additionally, there are the following un-highlighted occurrences:

- the name of the `inkathon.code-workspace` file
- the `package.json`'s name & metadata in the root directory as well as in the `contracts/` and `frontend/` packages
- the workspace dependency (`@inkathon/contracts`) defined in `frontend/package.json` and imported in `frontend/src/deployments/deployments.ts`

### 2. Custom Contracts

To replace the default `Greeter` contract or add a new one, you need to do the following:

- Add a new contract directory under `contracts/src/`
- Add it as another workspace member to the `contracts/Cargo.toml` file
- Add another deployment script or adjust `contracts/scripts/deploy.ts`
- Adjust the `ContractIds` enum and `getDeployments` function in `frontend/src/deployments/deployments.ts`

### 3. Custom Scripts

Adding custom scripts is useful to interact with your contracts or test certain functionality. Therefore, just duplicate & reuse the `contracts/scripts/script.template.ts` file and run it via `pnpm run script <script-name>`. This command will run the TypeScript file directly via [`tsx`](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx).

For general scripts, the same environment variable initialization & configuration applies as described below in the [Deployment](#deployment) section (e.g. to change the target network).

## Deployment üö¢

Spinning up a deployment via Vercel is pretty straightforward as the necessary settings are already configured in `vercel.json`. You can either use the Vercel CLI or the Vercel web interface to deploy the frontend.

### Environment Variables

One key element making this boilerplate so flexible is the usage of environment variables to configure the active network in the frontend. This is done by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_CHAIN` variable in the `frontend/.env.local` file, or in the Vercel deployment settings respectively.

All environment variables are imported from `process.env` in [`frontend/src/config/environment.ts`](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon/blob/main/frontend/src/config/environment.ts) and re-exported from there. For improved type safety, Always only import environment variables from `@/config/environment` and never directly from `process.env`.

### Contract Deployment

In the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section above, we've already deployed the sample `Greeter` contract on a local node. To target a live network, we can use the `CHAIN` environment variable when running the `deploy` script.

```bash
CHAIN=alephzero-testnet pnpm run deploy
```

Further, dynamically loaded environment files with the `.env.{chain}` naming convention can be used to add additional configuration about the deployer account.

```bash
# .env.alephzero-testnet
ACCOUNT_URI=bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alice
```

When running the same script again, this deployer account defined there will be used to sign the extrinsic.
